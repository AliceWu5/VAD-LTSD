# VAD-LTSD
Efficient voice activity detection (VAD) algorithms using long-term speech information

This repository contains a matlab code impelementation of the VAD based on the following [paper](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167639303001201)

       Ramırez, Javier, José C. Segura, Carmen Benıtez, Angel De La Torre, and Antonio Rubio.

## Usage
  
  Check out demo.m to see how you can use it to segement input audio WAV file.
  More importantly, check LTSD.m file to see the implementation. As a code-comment, I tried to put some notes refering to equations on the paper.
