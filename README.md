# VAD-LTSD
Efficient voice activity detection algorithms using long-term speech information

This repository contains a matlab code impelementation of the VAD based on the following [paper](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167639303001201)

## USAGE
  
  Check out demo.m to see how you can use it to segement audio wav file using VAD.
  More importantly check LTSD.m file to see how the implementend. I tried to put  some referece back to the equations 
  on the paper.
