# VAD-LTSD
Efficient voice activity detection algorithms using long-term speech information

This repository contains a matlab code impelementation of the VAD based on the following [paper](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167639303001201)

       Ramırez, Javier, José C. Segura, Carmen Benıtez, Angel De La Torre, and Antonio Rubio.

## Usage
  
  Check out demo.m to see how you can use it to segement audio wav file using VAD.
  More importantly check LTSD.m file to see the implementation. I tried to put referece back to the equations 
  on the paper.
